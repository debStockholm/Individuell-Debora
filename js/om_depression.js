# Depression: overview

**Depression**, or major depressive disorder (MDD), is a common yet serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed.\n 
It affects how one feels, thinks, and behaves, leading to various emotional and physical problems. Without treatment, depression can worsen and interfere with daily functioning. ​

**IMPORTANT: Depression is a multifactorial illness, meaning it does not depend on a single factor alone, but rather on a combination of two or more factors acting together.**\n

## India and depression: overview\n

_"In India, the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16 revealed 
that nearly 15% Indian adults need active intervention for one or more mental health issues and one in 20 Indians 
suffers from depression. It is estimated that in 2012, India had over 258 000 suicides, with the age-group of 15-49 years being most affected.
Although there are known, effective treatments for depression, fewer than half of those affected in the world 
(in many countries, fewer than 10%) receive such treatments. Barriers to effective care include a lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers, 
and social stigma associated with mental disorders. Another barrier to effective care is inaccurate assessment."_ (WHO)\n

_"Depression in India arises from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and socio-economic factors. 
Chronic stress, trauma, poverty, and social isolation are common contributors. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health issues, 
with a 2020 study reporting that 43% of Indians experienced depression during the lockdown."_ (The Times of India)\n


## Interesting facts about depression worldwide:
* According to CDC data from 2019, 21% of adults experiencing any depressive symptoms in the most recent two weeks were between 18 and 29 years old. This incidence is the largest among all adult age groups. And of adults with mild depression, the largest percentage were in this age group as well. So, while depression was more common for young adults, it was also less likely to be less severe.
Depression was not as prevalent among adults 30 and older, and severe depression did not vary much by age group. But moderate depression had the most significant impact on adults aged 45 to 65 years. Severity seemed to wane in older adulthood, with individuals aged 65 and over more commonly experiencing milder symptoms. (https://www.brainsway.com/knowledge-center/depression-across-age-groups/)
* Globally, an estimated 5% of adults suffer from depression (WHO)
* More women are affected by depression than men (WHO)
* A specific type of depression affects many people after childbirth - postpartum depression (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/depression-facts#cost)
* Depression costs workplaces billions of dollars (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/depression-facts#cost)
* Depression Is Strongly Linked to Gut Health
Research has hinted at a strong connection between gut health and mental well-being, noting that depression is strongly associated with gut imbalance. A nutritious diet including probiotics and prebiotics may play a role in managing depression, but more research is needed in this area (https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/major-depression-health-well-being/surprising-depression-facts/)
