  # Conclusion\n

 _Thoughts about the dataset:_ \n
 Clean and clear, even though doesn't provide enough information to look after deeper correlations or causality. Some googling can help.
 Also, and named before, I have some doubt about the reliability of some of the columns. Does Degree really indicate the degree students are pursuing?
 Is the Depression in the dataset 'officially diagnosed', or it it a 'self-made diagnosis'?
 Does the familiar mental health history refer to the depression diagnosis? 
 \n I had some doubts which could not be solved, so I worked through the most logical path according to me.

_What can we conclude out of this analysis?_

  * **Dietary habits**: students with depression seem to have overall worse dietary habits than the ones without depression;
    diet also tends to get 'healthier' the older you get;\n
  * **City**: not really a data I should have taken into account. Cities should have been sorted according to other parameters (climate, poverty rates, size and such), which I didn't, so it didn't really make sense;\n
  * **Financial stress**: (felt) higher in students with depression; it tends to get better the older you get. There wasn't a clear parameter to determine which students had a job or why they felt economy wasn't a issue anymore;\n
  * **Academic Pressure**: (felt) higher in students with depression; it tends to feel better the older you get; \n
  * **Study hours**: students with depression reports studying more than the counterpart, on average;\n
  * **CGPA**: quite alike;\n
  * **Sleep Duration**: both students with Depression and the ones without Depression have similar average sleeping hours; the first group most towards the 
      lowest range (5-6 hours - not optimal), the second group most towards the higher range (7-8 hours, optimal);\n
  * **Age**: youngest students are more likely to experiment depression (also worldwide). It gets better growing older;
  * **Mental health history of your family**: still do not know how to interpret this data. If you have depression running in your family you're more likely to develop it,
   but!, the % of people having depression _without_ recorded depression in the family is similar to the % of people having depression _with_ recorded depression in the family. 
   We'd probably should consider other parameters which are not in the dataset.

_General thoughts about what I have done:_
If I had to do this again, I would probably: sort by Age, or sort by Education pursuing and Age range: I think the academic related data can be important to understand why students feel the way they feel, and go deeper about that. 
(Personally understand the reasons why younger students pursuing high school degrees or bachelors are the most stressed/depressed - can relate).
Also, some of the conclusion I came accross, make sense when reading about how depression works. _Causality_ is a little hard to determine, because it can go both ways ('chicken-eggs' situation).\n
Also, according to research, globally do females tend to experiment more depression than males. I was going this way at the beginning, but in our dataset could not see big differences, so I 'stepped back'.\n

I also would have loved to have my graphs more interactive (like, they show stats when hoovering over them), but they are not working... they worked sometimes, and then not anymore. 
Didn't know ho to fix that.
