""" 
OBS this is way over my skills!  
Scriptiing comes from prompting Copilot - including AI.
 Best I can do without is easier if/else.

My logic before getting the code:
This looks like something where the program needs to run through the data and ´append´ only the relevant results 
on a list. 
First thing, define limits, dvs max number for each colors, so possibility or not can be matched.
Create a list to store the ID values which are possible.
Also program needs to understand how to read the data since is not a nice table format (if I had a paid version of
some data AI tools I´d convert the data to a table to be analyzed by SQL, to skip scripting ´how to read this´ on python, 
I did try but just took more time).
Then create a for-loop to go through the data once and save only the possible ID in the declared list.
By the end, count by hand or easily with sum().

so:
- Define the limit 
- Tell the program how to read the data I have (;, .)...
...and handling the data I do not have (like colors missing)
- Parse all data (once)
- Append (collect) only the ID which are possible when all the condition on the same line are met
- I may also make a sum to count all the values collected (ID) in the list, but I guess being a small dataset they can be counted easily
